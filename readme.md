# ResNeSt: Split-Attention Networks

This is an implementation of "ResNeSt: Split-Attention Networks" on Keras and Tensorflow using native Convolution groups
and weights.

The implementation is based on Hyungjin Kim's TF implementation, ([Burf/ResNeSt-Tensorflow2](https://github.com/Burf/ResNeSt-Tensorflow2)),
which is in turn based on the [official Torch implementation](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/ResNeSt).

## Requirements
- Python 3
- tensorflow 2.9
